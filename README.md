# Learning path to learn web development and system administration

## What is this about
The idea of this repository is to collect my learnings in the realm of web development and system administration.
The main idea is spend some time to reconsider what I have learned by writing this documentation as well as to have a quick look up of the most relevant concepts.
This is not intended to be a fully fledged tutorial on either of the presented topics for anyone else. However, I am happy to share these notes, in case people might find them useful.
None of the presented information or examples have been compiled by myself, but a rather a collection of information and examples I foudn elsewhere. I will do by best to cite the original documents.

## What I want to cover / achieve
This learning path is divided into two parts. On the one hand, I want to learn the basics of system administration. Here, the main goal is to be able to set up simple developments using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), as well as to learn the basics of self hosting with the help of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).
On the other hand, I am interested in learning the basics of web development. As a starting point, the tech stack I am interested in is HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the front end, as well as PHP and MySQL for the backend.
The list of either of the two mayor topic is not exhaustive and will probably we extended in the future.


## Found an error? Some misconception?
I do not expect to understand everything correctly immediately, so there might be some misconceptions or straight out errors in this document. If you find any, feel free to reach out to me and give me a hint, what I might need to have a second look at.
